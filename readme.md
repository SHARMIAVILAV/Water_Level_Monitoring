AIM: To create a water level monitoring system using nodemcu and ultrasonic sensor and blynk cloud.

MATERIALS REQUIRED:
Nodemcu ESP8266 
Ultrasonic sensor 
Relay module 
Jumper wires 
Breadboard  
EXPLANATION:
When the project is running, the Nodemcu board connected to the Blynk cloud via WIFI. The ultrasonic sensor also calculates the distance to the surface of the water. That is, the water level is calculated. These values are then displayed on the Blynk app. You can also turn the relay module ON / OFF with the button created in this Blynk app. That is, if a water pump is connected to the relay module, it can be turned ON / OFF.
